# Token Smart Contract

## Overview
Token is a Solidity smart contract designed for creating and managing tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It supports functionalities such as minting and burning tokens to adjust the total supply. The contract includes public variables for token details, a mapping for balance tracking, and methods for supply management.

## Features
- **Token Creation**: Mint new tokens to increase the total supply.
- **Token Destruction**: Burn tokens to decrease the total supply.
- **Balance Tracking**: Maintain and update token balances for addresses.
- **Ethereum Compatibility**: Designed for deployment on Ethereum blockchain networks.

## Getting Started
To deploy and interact with this contract:
1. Clone the repository locally or download the `Token.sol` file.
2. Use Remix, an online Solidity IDE, to compile and deploy the contract.
3. Interact with the deployed contract to mint or burn tokens using Remix's interface.

## Executing Program
1. *Create a New File*: 
   - Click on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar.
   - Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., MyToken.sol).
   - Copy and paste the code from this repo into the file:

2. *Compile the Code*:
   - Click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar.
   - Ensure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.18" (or another compatible version).
   - Click on the "Compile MyToken.sol" button.

3. *Deploy the Contract*:
   - Click on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar.
   - Select the "MyToken" contract from the dropdown menu.
   - Click on the "Deploy" button.

4. *Interact with the Contract*:
   - Once deployed, interact with the contract by calling the mint and burn functions.
   - For example, to mint tokens, input the address and value, and click on the mint function. Similarly, to burn tokens, input the address and value, and click on the burn function.
